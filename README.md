# Magento-2-Maintenance-Page

Short description:

The Magento 2 Maintenance Page extension by MageComp permits the merchant to create a customized page for the shoppers and it will be used to show them when your website is under maintenance, update or there is an upcoming product.

Long Description:

At times when the website is about to set up a new theme or a new extension is aligned or there is an upgrade in the Magento version or there is a minor bug fixing, then the store owner requires the website to get under maintenance for some time. So, in that case, directly showing a blank page that the website is under maintenance mode, doesn’t look appealing to the customer and your store might end up losing its customer base. 

So, instead of showing a blank sluggish maintenance page, you can show an informative and visually presentable maintenance and coming soon page on your website. To meet this requirement, MageComp has launched an all-new Maintenance Page Extension for Magento 2.

This extension comes with creating a customized page when your site is under maintenance mode and drawing the attention of the customers. Also, inform the customers when the site is back to work by sending them an email message. This extension gets along the countdown timer to display the users when the site will be ready. With just one command, the admin can enable or disable the maintenance mode. The users can easily subscribe in order to get the notification when the website is back in business. By using this extension, the admin can easily modify the coming soon page as per their requirements. The admin is also capable of appending social channel buttons in order to stay in contact with the customers.
